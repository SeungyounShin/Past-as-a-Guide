It starts with `power = 1` and keeps increasing it until `n**power` is greater than `x`. If at any point `n**power` equals `x`, it returns `True`, indicating that `x` is a simple power of `n`.

The function uses a while loop to increment the power until `n**power` is greater than `x`, checking at each step if `n**power` equals `x`.
