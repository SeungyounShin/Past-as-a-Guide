The Python script provided by the assistant correctly solves the problem and doesn't need debugging. The function was tested with the provided test cases and it returned the expected results. Therefore, the problem's resolution is verified through the tool's output.\n\n**Retrospection Draft**\nThe assistant's solution is efficient and correct. It uses a simple for loop to iterate over the elements in the array and checks if each element is greater than 10 and has both first and last digits as odd. This approach is straightforward and easy to understand. It could be useful in solving other similar problems.\n\n**Action Decision**\n```action\nAdd\n```\n\n**Retrospection Crafting**:\n\na.
